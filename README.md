## What is CMCS?
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a sophisticated web-based application specifically designed to simplify and enhance the management of monthly claims submitted by Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. As educational institutions increasingly rely on IC lecturers to provide quality instruction, the CMCS serves as a vital tool to streamline the often complex and labor-intensive task of processing claims for services rendered.

This application not only addresses the administrative burdens associated with claim submissions but also ensures that all stakeholders have a transparent and efficient system to track and manage claims.

## Purpose and Objectives
The primary purpose of the CMCS is to enhance the submission and approval process of claims, optimizing administrative efficiency and ensuring accuracy throughout the workflow. The key objectives include:

- **Improved Efficiency**: The CMCS automates routine tasks related to claim processing, thereby reducing manual effort and the potential for human error.
  
- **Faster Claim Processing**: By streamlining the workflow, the application reduces the time taken for claims to be reviewed and approved, allowing lecturers to receive timely compensation for their services.
  
- **Precise Data Entry and Calculations**: The system ensures accurate data entry and calculations, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the claims process and ensuring that payments are correct.
  
- **Enhanced Transparency**: The CMCS offers stakeholders visibility into the status of claim processing, from submission to final approval or rejection, fostering trust and accountability.

## Key Features

### Claim Submission
- **Intuitive Interface**: The CMCS provides a user-friendly interface that allows lecturers to submit claims with ease. This is crucial for ensuring that users of varying technical skills can navigate the system effectively.
  
- **Essential Information Capture**: The system captures vital information such as hours worked, hourly rates, as well as any other important information through an online form, ensuring all necessary data is collected upfront.
  
- **Document Upload**: Lecturers can upload supporting documents like timesheets or invoices, which are essential for substantiating their claims and ensuring comprehensive review.

### Claim Verification and Approval
- **Automated Workflows**: The CMCS introduces automated workflows that enhance the verification and approval processes, minimizing manual intervention and streamlining communication between users.
  
- **Systematic Routing**: Claims are automatically routed to Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers for processing, ensuring that each claim is reviewed by the appropriate personnel.
  
- **Decision Recording**: All decisions made regarding claims (approvals, rejections) are recorded and tracked within the system to ensure comprehensive transparency and accountability for all stakeholders involved.

### Status Monitoring
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Users can track the status of their claims in real-time, providing both lecturers and administrators with clear visibility of where each claim stands in the approval process.

### Administrative Management
- **Data Management Capabilities**: CMCS empowers Human Resources staff and administrators with a wide range of data management functionalities, including maintaining lecturer profiles and claim histories.
  
- **Seamless Database Integration**: The system can connect seamlessly with existing databases, allowing for better insights and facilitating informed decision-making based on historical data and trends.
  
- **Report Generation**: CMCS generates comprehensive reports for payment processing, auditing, and compliance, ensuring efficient administrative operations and adherence to institutional policies.

## Project Overview

### Target Audience
The CMCS caters to a diverse group of users within educational institutions, each with distinct roles and responsibilities:

- **Lecturers**: As the primary users of the system, lecturers are responsible for submitting claims, attaching supporting documents, and providing detailed information regarding their services. The system simplifies this process, ensuring timely and accurate submissions.
  
- **Programme Coordinators**: These users are tasked with scrutinizing claims to ensure accuracy and adherence to institutional standards. They verify that all claims submitted meet the necessary criteria before forwarding them for final approval.
  
- **Academic Managers**: Serving as the final approvers, Academic Managers review verified claims and make decisions based on established guidelines. Their oversight ensures that claims are managed with full accountability and a high level of scrutiny.
  
- **Human Resources Staff**: HR personnel manage the administrative tasks associated with maintaining lecturer data and processing claims. They utilize the CMCS to monitor claim histories, updates, and compliance reporting, promoting accuracy and efficiency in recordkeeping.
